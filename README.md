# thaipy-hypothesis-talk-20250322
Materials related to my talk at the ThaiPy meetup on 22nd May 2025

The only requirements are pytest and hypothesis. If you have `uv` installed, you can use:
* `uv run pytest test_base64.py`
* `uv run pytest test_account.py`
* `uv run pytest test_account_stateful.py`

I didn't have time to talk about the stateful tests, but they are a very powerful technique so worth studying!
